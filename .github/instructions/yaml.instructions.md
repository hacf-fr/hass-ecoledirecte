# YAML Instructions

**Applies to:** All YAML files

## Formatting Standards

- **2 spaces** for indentation (never tabs)
- No trailing whitespace
- End files with a single newline
- Use lowercase for keys (except where case matters)
- Prefer `>` for multi-line strings (folded) over inline strings
- Use `|` when preserving newlines is important

## Project-Specific Rules

- Keep files focused and readable
- Use comments to separate logical sections
- Group related configuration together
