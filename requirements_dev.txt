# Additional development tools beyond Home Assistant's requirements_test.txt
#
# Note: The following are already provided by HA's requirements_test.txt:
#   - pytest and pytest plugins (pytest-asyncio, pytest-aiohttp, pytest-cov, etc.)
#   - ruff (linting and formatting) via requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
#   - mypy-dev (type checking - we use pyright instead)
#   - codespell (spell checking) via requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
#   - pre-commit (hook framework)
#   - pylint (linting)
#
# Install with: uv pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

# Type Checking
# HA Core uses mypy, but we prefer pyright for better IDE integration and speed
pyright==1.1.407

# Better logging for development scripts
colorlog==6.10.1

# Performance optimizations (optional but recommended for faster development)
# These speed up Home Assistant's startup and runtime
