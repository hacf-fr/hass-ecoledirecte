# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides guidance for AI coding agents working on this Home Assistant custom integration project.

## Project Overview

This is a Home Assistant custom integration that was generated from a blueprint template. The integration follows Home Assistant Core development patterns and quality standards.

**Integration details:**

- **Domain:** `ecole_directe`
- **Title:** Ecole Directe
- **Repository:** Giga77/hass-ecoledirecte

**Key directories:**

- `custom_components/ecole_directe/` - Main integration code
- `config/` - Home Assistant configuration for local testing
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `script/` - Development and validation scripts

**Local Home Assistant instance:**

Test the integration using `./script/develop`. Important:

- **Force restart approach:** `pkill -f "hass --config" || true && pkill -f "debugpy.*5678" || true && ./script/develop`
- Kills any existing instance (hass + debugpy on port 5678) and starts fresh
- Avoids state confusion and port conflicts

**When to restart:** After modifying Python files, `manifest.json`, `services.yaml`, translations, or config flow changes

**Reading logs:**

- Live: Terminal where `./script/develop` runs
- File: `config/home-assistant.log` (most recent), `config/home-assistant.log.1` (previous)

**Adjusting log levels:**

- Integration logs: `custom_components.ecole_directe: debug` in `config/configuration.yaml`
- You can modify log levels when debugging - just restart HA after changes

**Context-specific instructions:**

If you're using GitHub Copilot, path-specific instructions in `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` provide additional guidance for specific file types (Python, YAML, JSON, etc.). This document serves as the primary reference for all agents.

## Working With Developers

**For workflow basics (small changes, translations, tests, session management):** See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for quick-reference guidance.

### When Instructions Conflict With Requests

If a developer requests something that contradicts these instructions:

1. **Clarify the intent** - Ask if they want you to deviate from the documented guidelines
2. **Confirm understanding** - Restate what you understood to avoid misinterpretation
3. **Suggest instruction updates** - If this represents a permanent change in approach, offer to update these instructions
4. **Proceed once confirmed** - Follow the developer's explicit direction after clarification

### Maintaining These Instructions

**This project was recently initialized from a template.** Instructions should evolve as the project matures:

- Refine guidelines based on actual project needs
- Remove outdated rules that no longer apply
- Consolidate redundant sections to prevent bloat
- Keep files focused - Move architectural decisions to `docs/development/`

**Propose updates when:**

- You notice repeated deviations from documented patterns
- Instructions become outdated or contradict actual code
- New patterns emerge that should be standardized

### Documentation vs. Instructions

**Three types of content with clear separation:**

1. **Agent Instructions** - How AI should write code (`.github/instructions/`, `AGENTS.md`)
2. **Developer Documentation** - Architecture and design decisions (`docs/development/`)
3. **User Documentation** - End-user guides (`docs/user/`)

**AI Planning:** Use `.ai-scratch/` for temporary notes (never committed)

**Rules:**

- ❌ **NEVER** create random markdown files in code directories
- ❌ **NEVER** create documentation in `.github/` unless it's a GitHub-specified file
- ✅ **ALWAYS ask first** before creating permanent documentation
- ✅ **Prefer module docstrings** over separate markdown files

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed documentation strategy.

### Session and Context Management

**Commit suggestions:**

When a task completes and the developer moves to a new topic, suggest committing changes. Offer a commit message based on the work done.

**Commit message format:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification

**Common types:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for commit message examples and context monitoring guidance.

## Custom Integration Flexibility

**This is a CUSTOM integration, not a Home Assistant Core integration.** While we follow Core patterns for quality and maintainability, we have more flexibility in implementation decisions:

**Third-party libraries (PyPI):**

- ✅ Prefer existing PyPI libraries when maintained and fit the use case
- ✅ Build custom API client when:
  - Device/service uses simple REST API or GraphQL (HTTP, JSON)
  - Available libraries are unmaintained, bloated, or poorly designed
  - Using aiohttp + json is more maintainable than a framework

**Decision process:**

1. Research available libraries (PyPI, GitHub)
2. Evaluate: Maintained? Async? Well-documented? Dependency footprint?
3. Consider protocol: Simple REST → aiohttp; Complex OAuth2 → library; Standard (MQTT) → industry library
4. Document decision in `docs/development/DECISIONS.md`

**Quality Scale expectations:**

As an AI agent, **aim for Silver or Gold Quality Scale** when generating code:

- ✅ **Always implement:** Type hints, async patterns, proper error handling, service registration in `async_setup()`, diagnostics with `async_redact_data()`, device info
- 🎯 **When applicable:** Config flow with validation, reauth flow, discovery support, repair flows
- 📋 **Can defer:** Multiple config entries, advanced discovery, YAML import, extensive test coverage

**Developer expectation:** Generate production-ready code. Implement HA standards with reasonable effort.

**Other flexibility:** Discovery can be added later; breaking changes allowed with documentation; experimental features acceptable.

## Code Style and Quality

**Python:** 4 spaces, 120 char lines, double quotes, full type hints, async for all I/O

**YAML:** 2 spaces, modern HA syntax (no legacy `platform:` style)

**JSON:** 2 spaces, no trailing commas, no comments

**Validation:** Run `script/check` before committing (runs type-check + lint + spell)

**hassfest validation:** Run `script/hassfest` to validate against Home Assistant standards

- Validates manifest.json, translations, services.yaml, and integration structure
- Uses official Home Assistant Core validation scripts locally
- First run downloads ~27 MB, subsequent runs are fast with `--no-update`

**For comprehensive standards, see:**

- `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` - Python patterns, imports, type hints
- `.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md` - YAML structure and HA-specific patterns
- `.github/instructions/json.instructions.md` - JSON formatting and schema validation

**GitHub Copilot users:** These instruction files are automatically provided based on file type.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Integration Identifiers

This integration uses the following identifiers consistently:

- **Domain:** `ecole_directe`
- **Title:** Ecole Directe
- **Class prefix:** `ED`

**When creating new files:**

- Use the domain `ecole_directe` for all DOMAIN references
- Prefix all integration-specific classes with `ED`
- Use "Ecole Directe" as the display title
- Never hardcode different values

### Integration Structure

**Package organization (DO NOT create other packages):**

- `api/` - API client and exceptions
- `coordinator/` - Data update coordinator
- `config_flow_handler/` - Config flow, options, validators, schemas
  - `validators/*.py` - Config flow validation functions
  - `schemas/*.py` - Data schemas for config flow steps
- `entity/` - Base entity classes
- `entity_utils/` - Entity-specific helpers (device_info, state formatting)
- `[platform]/` - Entity platforms (sensor, switch, etc.)
- `service_actions/` - Service action implementations
- `utils/` - Integration-wide utilities (string helpers, general validators)

**Do NOT create:**

- `helpers/`, `ha_helpers/`, or similar packages - use `utils/` or `entity_utils/` instead
- `common/`, `shared/`, `lib/` - use existing packages above
- New top-level packages without explicit approval

**Key patterns:**

- Entities → Coordinator → API Client (never skip layers)
- Each platform in own directory with `__init__.py`
- One entity class per file for clarity
- Individual entity classes in separate files (e.g., `air_quality.py`)
- Use `EntityDescription` dataclasses for static entity metadata

**Code organization principles:**

- Keep files focused (200-400 lines per file)
- One class per file for entity implementations
- Split large modules into smaller ones when needed

**For detailed patterns, see:**

- `.github/instructions/entities.instructions.md` - Entity platform patterns
- `.github/instructions/coordinator.instructions.md` - Coordinator implementation
- `.github/instructions/api.instructions.md` - API client patterns

### Device Info

All entities should provide consistent device info via the base entity class (manufacturer, model, serial number, configuration URL, firmware version).

### Integration Manifest

**Key fields in `manifest.json`:**

**integration_type** (CRITICAL):

- `hub` - Gateway to multiple devices/services (e.g., Philips Hue bridge)
- `device` - Single device per config entry (e.g., ESPHome device)
- `service` - Single service per config entry (e.g., DuckDNS)
- `helper` - Helper entity (e.g., input_boolean, group)
- `virtual` - Points to another integration/IoT standard (not for custom integrations)

**Rule:** Hub vs Service/Device is defined by nature: Hub = gateway to multiple devices/services; Service/Device = one per config entry.

**quality_scale:**

- Required for Core integrations (minimum `bronze`)
- Optional for custom integrations (not displayed in HA UI)
- Levels: `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`, `platinum`, `internal`
- If included, serves as self-documentation of code quality goals
- See [Integration Quality Scale](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale)

**iot_class:**

- `cloud_polling`, `cloud_push`, `local_polling`, `local_push`, `assumed_state`, `calculated`

**dependencies vs after_dependencies:**

- `dependencies` - Required, integration won't load without them
- `after_dependencies` - Optional, waits if configured

**Discovery methods:** `bluetooth`, `dhcp`, `homekit`, `mqtt`, `ssdp`, `usb`, `zeroconf`

- Define matchers in manifest
- Requires corresponding `async_step_<method>()` in config flow
- Unique ID required for discovery

**single_config_entry:** Set `true` to allow only one config entry per integration

See `.github/instructions/manifest.instructions.md` for comprehensive manifest documentation.

### Config Flow Best Practices

**Reserved step names:**

- Discovery: `bluetooth`, `dhcp`, `homekit`, `mqtt`, `ssdp`, `usb`, `zeroconf`
- System: `user`, `reauth`, `reconfigure`, `import`

**Unique ID requirements (CRITICAL):**

- Acceptable: Serial number, MAC address, device ID, account ID
- Unacceptable: IP address, device name, hostname, URL

**Reconfigure vs Reauth:**

- `reconfigure` - Change config data (host, settings)
- `reauth` - Handle expired credentials

**Config entry migration:**

- Define `VERSION` and `MINOR_VERSION` in ConfigFlow
- Implement `async_migrate_entry()` in `__init__.py`
- Update entry with `hass.config_entries.async_update_entry()`
- Return `False` to reject downgrades

**Scaffold commands:**

```bash
python3 -m script.scaffold config_flow_discovery  # Discoverable, no auth
python3 -m script.scaffold config_flow_oauth2     # OAuth2 flow
```

## Home Assistant Patterns

**Config flow:**

- Implement in `config_flow_handler/` package
- Support user setup, discovery, reauth, reconfigure
- Always set unique_id for discovered entries

See `.github/instructions/config_flow.instructions.md` for comprehensive patterns.

**Service actions:**

- Define in `services.yaml` with full descriptions (legacy filename)
- Implement handlers in `service_actions/` directory
- **Register in `async_setup()`** - NOT in `async_setup_entry()` (Quality Scale!)
- Format: `<integration_domain>.<action_name>`

See `.github/instructions/services.instructions.md` for service patterns.

**Coordinator:**

- Entities → Coordinator → API Client (never skip layers)
- Raise `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` (triggers reauth) or `UpdateFailed` (retry)
- Use `async_config_entry_first_refresh()` for first update

See `.github/instructions/coordinator.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/api.instructions.md` for details.

**Entities:**

- Inherit from platform base + `EDEntity`
- Read from `coordinator.data`, never call API directly
- Use `EntityDescription` for static metadata

See `.github/instructions/entities.instructions.md` for entity patterns.

**Repairs:**

- Create `repairs.py` in integration root (Gold Quality Scale)
- Use `async_create_issue()` with severity levels (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Implement `RepairsFlow` for guided user fixes
- Delete issues after successful repair

See `.github/instructions/repairs.instructions.md` for comprehensive patterns.

**Entity availability:**

- Set `_attr_available = False` when device is unreachable
- Update availability based on coordinator success/failure
- Don't raise exceptions from `@property` methods

**State updates:**

- Use `self.async_write_ha_state()` for immediate updates
- Let coordinator handle periodic updates
- Minimize API calls (batch requests when possible)

**Setup failure handling:**

- `ConfigEntryNotReady` - Device offline/timeout, auto-retry, don't log manually (HA logs at debug)
- `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` - Expired credentials, triggers reauth flow, alternative: `entry.async_start_reauth()`

**Diagnostics:**

- **CRITICAL:** Use `async_redact_data()` from `homeassistant.helpers.redact` to remove sensitive data
- Redact: Passwords, API keys, tokens, location data, personal information

**YAML Configuration:**

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** for integrations communicating with devices/services (ADR-0010)

- New integrations MUST use config flow
- Existing YAML integrations should migrate to config flow
- Only helpers and system integrations may use YAML

## Validation Scripts

**Before committing, run:**

```bash
script/check      # Full validation (type + lint + spell)
script/lint       # Auto-format and fix linting issues
script/type-check # Pyright type checking only
script/test       # Run unit tests
```

**Configured tools:**

- **Ruff** - Fast Python linter and formatter ([Rules Reference](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/))
- **Pyright** - Type checker configured for "basic" mode ([Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/))
- **pytest** - Test runner with async support ([Docs](https://docs.pytest.org/))

**Generate code that passes these checks on first run.** As an AI agent, you should produce higher quality code than manual development:

- Type hints are trivial for you to generate
- Async patterns are well-known to you
- Import management is automatic for you
- Naming conventions can be applied consistently

Aim for zero validation errors in generated code. The developer expects production-ready output.

See `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` for linter overrides and error recovery strategies.

- You may use `# noqa: CODE` or `# type: ignore` when genuinely necessary
- Use sparingly and only with good reason (e.g., false positives, external library issues)
See `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` for linter overrides and error recovery strategies.

### Error Recovery Strategy

**When validation fails (`script/check` errors):**

1. **First attempt** - Fix the specific error reported by the tool
2. **Second attempt** - If it fails again, reconsider your approach (maybe your understanding was wrong)
3. **Third attempt** - If still failing, ask for clarification rather than looping indefinitely
4. **After 3 failed attempts** - Stop and explain what you tried and why it's not working

**When tool operations fail:**

- **File read/write errors** - Verify path exists, check for typos, try once more
- **Terminal timeouts** - Don't retry automatically; inform the user and suggest manual intervention
- **API/network timeouts in tests** - Mention in response, don't silently ignore
- **Git operations fail** - Report the error immediately; don't attempt to work around it

**When gathering context:**

- Start with semantic_search (1-2 queries maximum)
- Read 3-5 most relevant files based on search results
- If still unclear, read 2-3 more specific files
- **After ~10 file reads, you should have enough context** - make a decision or ask for clarification
- Don't fall into infinite research loops

**Context gathering strategy:**

1. **First pass** - semantic_search to find relevant areas (1-2 queries)
2. **Second pass** - Read the 3-5 most relevant files identified
3. **Evaluate** - Do you have enough context to proceed? If yes, start implementation
4. **Third pass (if needed)** - Read 2-3 additional specific files for missing details
5. **Decision point** - After ~10 file reads total, you must either:
   - Proceed with implementation based on available context
   - Ask the developer specific questions about what's unclear
   - Never continue searching indefinitely without making progress

## Testing

**Test structure:**

- `tests/` mirrors `custom_components/ecole_directe/` structure
- Use fixtures for common setup (Home Assistant mock, coordinator, etc.)
- Mock external API calls

**Running tests:**

```bash
script/test                           # All tests
script/test --cov-html                # With coverage report
script/test --snapshot-update         # Update Syrupy snapshots
```

See `.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md` for comprehensive testing patterns.

## Breaking Changes

**Always warn the developer before making changes that:**

- Change entity IDs or unique IDs (users' automations will break)
- Modify config entry data structure (existing installations will fail)
- Change state values or attributes format (dashboards and automations affected)
- Alter service call signatures (user scripts will break)
- Remove or rename config options (users must reconfigure)

**Never do without explicit approval:**

- Removing config options (even if "unused")
- Changing service parameters or return values
- Modifying how data is stored in config entries
- Renaming entities or changing their device classes
- Changing unique_id generation logic

**How to warn:**

> "⚠️ This change will modify the entity ID format from `sensor.device_name` to `sensor.device_name_sensor`. Existing users' automations and dashboards will break. Should I proceed, or would you prefer a migration path?"

**When breaking changes are necessary:**

- Document the breaking change in commit message (`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer)
- Consider providing migration instructions
- Suggest version bump (major version change)
- Update documentation if it exists

## File Changes

**Scope Management:**

**Single logical feature or fix:**

- Implement completely even if it spans 5-8 files
- Example: New sensor needs entity class + platform init + code → implement all together
- Example: Bug fix requires changes in coordinator + entity + error handling → do all at once

**Multiple independent features:**

- Implement one at a time
- After completing each feature, suggest committing before proceeding to the next

**Large refactoring (>10 files or architectural changes):**

- Propose a plan first before starting implementation
- Get explicit confirmation from developer

**Important: Do NOT create or modify tests unless explicitly requested.** Focus on implementing functionality. The developer decides when and if tests are needed.

**Translation strategy:**

- Use placeholders in code (e.g., `"config.step.user.title"`) - functionality works without translations
- Update `en.json` only when asked or at major feature completion
- NEVER update other language files automatically - extremely time-consuming
- Ask before updating multiple translation files
- Priority: Business logic first, translations later

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed workflow guidance.

## Research and Validation

**When uncertain, consult official documentation:**

- **Always check current patterns** in [Home Assistant Developer Docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)
- **Read the blog** at [Home Assistant Developer Blog](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/) for recent changes and best practices
- **Search for examples** using Google: `site:developers.home-assistant.io [your topic]`
- **Verify with tools** before assuming - run `script/check` to catch issues early

**Don't rely on assumptions:**

- Home Assistant APIs and patterns evolve frequently
- What worked in older versions may be deprecated
- Use official docs and working examples over guesswork
- When in doubt, search for recent integration examples in Home Assistant Core

**Tool documentation:**

- [Ruff Rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) - Understand what each rule checks
- [Pyright Configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration) - Type checking options
- Don't hesitate to look up specific error codes when validation fails

## Tool Parallelization

**Safe to call in parallel:**

- Multiple `read_file` operations (different files or different sections of same file)
- `file_search` + `read_file` + `grep_search` (independent read-only operations)
- `semantic_search` followed by parallel `read_file` of results (but only 1 semantic_search at a time)

**Never call in parallel:**

- Multiple `run_in_terminal` commands (execute sequentially, wait for output)
- Multiple `replace_string_in_file` on the same file (use `multi_replace_string_in_file` instead)
- `semantic_search` with other `semantic_search` (execute one at a time)

**Best practices:**

- Batch independent read operations together in one parallel call
- After gathering context in parallel, provide brief progress update before proceeding
- For file edits, use `multi_replace_string_in_file` when making multiple changes
- Terminal commands must always be sequential to see output before next command
